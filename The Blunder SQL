Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's  key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), and the actual average salary.

Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.:  average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.

Input Format

The EMPLOYEES table is described as follows:

Note: Salary is per month.



Sample Output

2061


-- Calculate the actual average salary
WITH ActualAverage AS (
    SELECT AVG(Salary) AS actual_avg_salary
    FROM EMPLOYEES
),



-- Calculate the average salary with zeros removed
ModifiedSalaries AS (
    SELECT CAST(REPLACE(CAST(Salary AS CHAR), '0', '') AS DECIMAL) AS modified_salary
    FROM EMPLOYEES
),

ModifiedAverage AS (
    SELECT AVG(modified_salary) AS modified_avg_salary
    FROM ModifiedSalaries
)

-- Calculate the difference and round it up to the next integer
SELECT CEIL(ABS(ActualAverage.actual_avg_salary - ModifiedAverage.modified_avg_salary)) AS error
FROM ActualAverage, ModifiedAverage;
